React Notifications
==========

The base idea is to make a notification system that is:
* efficient
* intuitive
* easy to add to an existing project

The result is a React Context based system with the possibility to easily create notifications to containers,
and easily display them in the UI.

Common scenarios that this approach tries to cover:
* notifications that are informative and are removed automatically
* dismissable notifications
* custom notification content
* unrestricted design choices and placements

## Testing
Based on `create-react-app`. Clone the repository and run `yarn install && yarn start`.
